## Python Flask

In this Python Flask, we will be learning how to restructure our application to use blueprints. Blueprints allow us to split up our application into more manageable sections. 

We will also move our configuration into its own file and create a configuration class. Lastly, we will move the creation of our application into its own function. This is called an Application Factory, and it allows us to easily create multiple instances of our app with different configurations# tuffjourney
